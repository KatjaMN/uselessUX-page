It’s about enabling you a nice and smooth visit on a site, so that you right away know what you are expected to do and how the site works. In an optimal case you find easily what you are looking for and have a pleasant experience of navigating the site. Sounds good, doesn’t it?
            <br><br>
        Now, this site really doesn’t work that way. It wasn’t designed to do so. I guess you have by now already asked yourself what’s going on and what are you supposed to do. Well, you are supposed to play and find! In the end I'd love to hear what you think. Thank's for stopping by!</p>
